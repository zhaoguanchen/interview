# why uber?

Uber 让乘客和司机更方便。乘客可以在手机上管理自己的行程。对于我来说，更重要的是我能知道多少钱。司机可以轻松的在driver client app上安排自己的工作和路线。

同样的，对于客人和餐厅来说，Uber eats发挥着很大的作用。

因此，我认为，uber是一家改变了世界的公司。我非常希望加入他。

**Uber makes it easier for riders and drivers. Passengers can manage their trips on their phones. For me, it's more important that I can know how much it costs. Drivers can easily schedule their jobs and routes on the driver client app.** **Similarly, for guests and restaurants, Uber eats plays a big role.** **Therefore, I think uber is a company that has changed the world. I am very eager to join him.**



**About this position, I learned that it is Platform Engineer which will build and maintain backend services and solutions to support user-facing products, downstream services, or infrastructure tools and platforms used globally. Although it is not user-oriented, it is really the most important. It plays an important role in the stability of business applications and the efficiency of development within the company.**
