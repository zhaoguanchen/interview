Uber 

```
We are given a list of flight information where each entry contains a departure city, arrival city, departure time, and arrival time.
Given two cities A and B, write a function to determine if it is possible to fly from A to B. If it is possible return the path, otherwise return false.
Example:
"Dallas", "Chicago", 1, 2
"Dallas", "Detroit", 2, 5
"Chicago", "Dallas", 4, 5
‍‍‍"Chicago", "Milwaukee", 3, 4
"Chicago", "Denver", 4, 6
"Miami", "New York", 5, 8
"New York", "Boston", 7, 9
