leetcode 19

very classic amazon, design parking garage

1 big and park in 4 small

find the duplicate in a list of length n, list start from 1
need to be in O(1) space and not use sum as it can be overflow
similar to leetcode 268

increment, decrement, incre then decre, decre then incre.

Is similar to leetcode 207
