# 1. swap to make strictly increasing
You are given an array of non-negative integers numbers. You are allowed to choose any number from this array and swap any two digits in it. If after the swap operation the number contains leading zeros, they can be omitted and not considered (eg: 010 will be considered just 10).

Your task is to check whether it is possible to apply the swap operation at most once, so that the elements of the resulting array are strictly increasing.

Example

For numbers = [1, 5, 10, 20], the output should be makeIncreasing(numbers) = true.
The initial array is already strictly increasing, so no actions are required.

For numbers = [1, 3, 900, 10], the output should be makeIncreasing(numbers) = true.
By choosing numbers[2] = 900 and swapping its first and third digits, the resulting number 009 is considered to be just 9. So the updated array will look like [1, 3, 9, 10], which is strictly increasing.

For numbers = [13, 31, 30], the output should be makeIncreasing(numbers) = false.
The initial array elements are not increasing.
By swapping the digits of numbers[0] = 13, the array becomes [31, 31, 30] which is not strictly increasing;
By swapping the digits of numbers[1] = 31, the array becomes [13, 13, 30] which is not strictly increasing;
By swapping the digits of numbers[2] = 30, the array becomes [13, 31, 3] which is not strictly increasing;
So, it's not possible to obtain a strictly increasing array, and the answer is false.




# 2. Map

You've created a new programming language, and now you've decided to add hashmap support to it. Actually you are quite disappointed that in common programming languages it's impossible to add a number to all hashmap keys, or all its values. So you've decided to take matters into your own hands and implement your own hashmap in your new language that has the following operations:

insert x y - insert an object with key x and value y.
get x - return the value of an object with key x.
addToKey x - add x to all keys in map.
addToValue y - add y to all values in map.
To test out your new hashmap, you have a list of queries in the form of two arrays: queryTypes contains the names of the methods to be called (eg: insert, get, etc), and queries contains the arguments for those methods (the x and y values).

Your task is to implement this hashmap, apply the given queries, and to find the sum of all the results for get operations.

Example

For queryType = ["insert", "insert", "addToValue", "addToKey", "get"] and query = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2], [1], [3]], the output should be solution(queryType, query) = 5.

The hashmap looks like this after each query:

1 query: {1: 2}
2 query: {1: 2, 2: 3}
3 query: {1: 4, 2: 5}
4 query: {2: 4, 3: 5}
5 query: answer is 5
The result of the last get query for 3 is 5 in the resulting hashmap.

# 3. 
Minesweeper is a popular single-player computer game. The goal is to locate mines within a rectangular grid of cells. At the start of the game, all of the cells are concealed. On each turn, the player clicks on a blank cell to reveal its contents, leading to the following result:
If there's a mine on this cell, the player loses and the game is over;
Otherwise, a number appears on the cell, representing how many mines there are within the 8 neighbouring cells (up, down, left, right, and the 4 diagonal directions);
If the revealed number is 0, each of the 8 neighbouring cells are automatically revealed in the same way.
demonstration

You are given a boolean matrix field representing the distribution of bombs in the rectangular field. You are also given integers x and y, representing the coordinates of the player's first clicked cell - x represents the row index, and y represents the column index, both of which are 0-based.

Your task is to return an integer matrix of the same dimensions as field, representing the resulting field after applying this click. If a cell remains concealed, the corresponding element should have a value of -1.

It is guaranteed that the clicked cell does not contain a mine.

Example

For
field = [[false, true, true],
         [true, false, true],
         [false, false, true]]
x = 1, and y = 1, the output should be

solution(field, x, y) = [[-1, -1, -1],
                         [-1, 5, -1],
                         [-1, -1, -1]]
example

There are 5 neighbors of the cell (1, 1) which contain a mine, so the value in (1, 1) should become 5, and the other elements of the resulting matrix should be -1 since no other cell would be expanded.

For
field = [[true, false, true, true, false],
         [true, false, false, false, false],
         [false, false, false, false, false],
         [true, false, false, false, false]]
x = 3, and y = 2, the output should be

solution(field, x, y) = [[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
                         [-1, 3, 2, 2, 1],
                         [-1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
                         [-1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
example

Since the value in the cell (3, 2) is 0, all of its neighboring cells ((2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3)) are also revealed. Since the value in the cell (2, 2) is also 0, its neighbouring cells (1, 1), (1, 2) and (1, 3) are revealed, and since the value in cell (2, 3) is 0, its neighbours (1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 4) are also revealed. The cells (3, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4) also contain the value 0, but since all of their neighbours have already been revealed, no further action is required.

4. 

You are given a string s. Consider the following algorithm applied to this string:

Take all the prefixes of the string, and choose the longest palindrome between them.
If this chosen prefix contains at least two characters, cut this prefix from s and go back to the first step with the updated string. Otherwise, end the algorithm with the current string s as a result.
Your task is to implement the above algorithm and return its result when applied to string s.

Note: you can click on the prefixes and palindrome words to see the definition of the terms if you're not familiar with them.

Example

For s = "aaacodedoc", the output should be solution(s) = "".

The initial string s = "aaacodedoc" contains only three prefixes which are also palindromes - "a", "aa", "aaa". The longest one between them is "aaa", so we cut if from s.
Now we have string "codedoc". It contains two prefixes which are also palindromes - "c" and "codedoc". The longest one between them is "codedoc", so we cut if from the current string and obtain the empty string.
Finally the algorithm ends on the empty string, so the answer is "".
For s = "codesignal", the output should be solution(s) = "codesignal".
The initial string s = "codesignal" contains the only prefix, which is also palindrome - "c". This prefix is the longest, but doesn't contain two characters, so the algorithm ends with string "codesignal" as a result.

For s = "", the output should be solution(s) = "".
