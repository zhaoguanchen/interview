2018年，我从北京科技大学毕业，取得了计算机科学与技术的学士学位。

为了积累一些工业界的经验，我找到了软件开发的工作并拥有了两段工作经历。

第一段工作是跟大数据相关的java开发，主要工作任务是数据监控服务的开发以及对以CDH为基础的大数据平台的维护工作。

第二段工作更面向业务。在前期我参与crm平台的后端研发。后来我被划分到新组，并开始主导css系统的开发工作。这是我最喜欢的一段工作经历，因为我和我的团队以及其他团队都保持着良好的关系。


去年，我来到了美国，开始了研究生的校园生活。 我的专业是计算机科学与系统。起初我认为因为一些政策限制我不能得到opt，所以打算回国的。然而在这个6月意外的获得了EAD卡。这就是为什么我现在才开始找工作。

在技术方面，我主要擅长基于Java的后端服务开发，尤其是SPring boot， Mysql, Kafka 和redis.




Hi Orlando,

I am very happy to receive this call.

Let me introduce myself to you. 

In 2018, I graduated from University of Science and Technology Beijing with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology.

To gain some experience in industry, I found a job in software development and had two work experiences.

The first job was java development related to big data, and the main task was the development of data monitoring services and the maintenance of the CDH-based big data platform.

The second period of work is more business-oriented. In the first period, I was involved in the back-end development of the CRM platform. Later I was divided into a new group and started to lead the development work of css system. This was my favorite part of my work experience because I maintained good relationships with my team and other teams.


Last year, I came to the US and started my campus life as a graduate student. My major is Computer Science and Systems.  And I graduated this Spring. At first I thought I couldn't get opt because of some policy restrictions, so I planned to return to my country. However, in this June, I unexpectedly got the EAD card. That's why I am just now starting to look for a job.


On the technical side, I am mainly specialized in Java based backend service development, especially SPring boot, Mysql, Kafka and redis.



为什么选择这个组？

因为我了解到这个组是要做一个新的产品。我非常喜欢从零开始做一件事情，就像我之前做的CSS系统一样，我会把它视为自己的孩子。每一行代码都是我亲手写的。这是一个非常棒的感觉。


另外一个原因是我们这个组主要负责仓库员工的排班，这将大大提高员工的工作效率。这将是一件非常有意义的事情。

Why did you choose this group?

Because I learned that this group is to make a new product. I really like to make something from scratch, just like the CSS system I made before, and I will consider it as my own child. Every line of code was written by my own hand. It's a really great feeling.


Another reason is that our group is mainly responsible for the scheduling of the warehouse staff, which will greatly improve the efficiency of the staff. It will be a very meaningful thing.



因为后来经历了一次组织架构变动，我转到另一个做数据报表的组。我发现这个工作比较没有意义，且对我技术能力成长帮助不多。所以我决定换一个环境，做一些更具有业务背景的需求。

Because then I went through an organizational change and moved to another group that did data reporting. I found the job was rather meaningless and did not help me much to grow my technical skills. So I decided to change the environment and do something with more business context.



我想知道面试流程
